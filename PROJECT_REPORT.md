## Project Requirements

### Original Request
Build a Python script that:
1. Logs into TikTok account using Playwright
2. Navigates to following/followers list
3. Identifies banned or deleted accounts
4. Unfollows those accounts automatically
5. Implements rate limiting (few per session, hours between runs)
6. Works on Windows (with browser GUI support)
7. Includes git version control

### Additional Requirements Discovered
- MFA/2FA support (human-in-the-loop)
- State persistence to resume between runs
- Robust error handling for production use
- Configuration via environment variables
- Comprehensive documentation

---

## Architecture & Design

### Technology Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.7+
- **Browser Automation:** Playwright (Chromium)
- **Configuration:** python-dotenv (.env files)
- **State Management:** JSON file persistence
- **Version Control:** Git

### Core Components

#### 1. Configuration Layer (Lines 15-48)
- Environment variable loading with validation
- Fallback to safe defaults on invalid values
- Validates positive integers and type conversions
- Handles: UNFOLLOW_DELAY, BATCH_SIZE, ACTION_DELAY, HEADLESS mode

#### 2. State Management (Lines 59-96)
- JSON-based persistence in `state.json`
- Tracks: last run time, processed accounts, unfollowed accounts
- Corrupted file detection with automatic backup
- Safe defaults when state is missing

#### 3. Browser Automation (Lines 109-153)
- Playwright lifecycle management
- Anti-detection measures (user agent, disabled automation flags)
- Realistic viewport and settings
- Proper resource cleanup

#### 4. Authentication (Lines 155-189)
- Automated login form filling
- MFA/2FA human-in-the-loop support
- Multiple selector fallbacks for UI changes
- Timeout handling with manual override option

#### 5. Navigation & Validation (Lines 191-250)
- Profile URL extraction and parsing
- Following page navigation
- Page validation to ensure correct location
- Human intervention prompts when needed

#### 6. Follower Loading (Lines 252-293)
- Infinite scroll implementation
- Progress tracking
- Zero-follower edge case handling
- Safety limits (max 15,000 accounts)

#### 7. Account Detection (Lines 295-337)
- Pattern matching for invalid accounts
- Multiple detection criteria:
  - "banned" / "banned account"
  - "account not found" / "user not found"
  - "content is unavailable"
  - Missing or placeholder usernames
  - No username element found

#### 8. Unfollow Engine (Lines 339-466)
- Batch processing with configurable size
- Stale element protection (re-queries DOM)
- Rate limiting between actions
- Progress persistence after each unfollow
- Comprehensive error handling

#### 9. Resource Cleanup (Lines 468-486)
- Graceful shutdown of context, browser, playwright
- Exception handling during cleanup
- Prevents resource leaks

#### 10. Main Execution Flow (Lines 488-536)
- Credential validation
- Rate limit enforcement
- Keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C) handling
- Traceback printing for debugging
- Always-cleanup guarantee (finally block)

## Bug Fixes Applied

### Critical Bugs

| # | Issue | Impact | Fix |
|---|-------|--------|-----|
| 1 | '@' in invalid_indicators | Would flag ALL accounts as invalid since every TikTok username contains '@' | Changed to check for exact matches like '@' or '@_' only |
| 2 | Playwright instance leak | Memory leak, resource exhaustion over time | Store self.playwright and call .stop() in cleanup |
| 3 | Stale element exceptions | Unfollow would fail after first action as DOM updates | Re-query elements by index instead of storing references |

### Important Bugs

| # | Issue | Impact | Fix |
|---|-------|--------|-----|
| 4 | No state.json error handling | Script crashes on corrupted JSON | Try/except with backup creation and validation |
| 5 | No config validation | Script crashes on invalid env vars | Validate all integers with fallback defaults |
| 6 | Bare except clauses | Catches all exceptions including KeyboardInterrupt | Use specific exception types |
| 7 | Fragile URL parsing | Could crash on unexpected URL formats | Add validation checks before split operations |

### Minor Bugs

| # | Issue | Impact | Fix |
|---|-------|--------|-----|
| 8 | No zero-follower check | Infinite loop if no followers load | Added max_attempts and early return |
| 9 | No page validation | Could operate on wrong page | Added validate_on_following_page() |
| 10 | No Ctrl+C handling | Ungraceful shutdown, lost progress | KeyboardInterrupt exception handler |
| 11 | Incomplete cleanup | Context not closed, only browser | Close context → browser → playwright in order |
| 12 | No save_state() error handling | Could crash on disk full or permissions | Added IOError/OSError exception handling |

## Security & Safety Features

### Implemented Safeguards

1. **Credential Protection**
   - Credentials stored in `.env` file (gitignored)
   - Never logged or exposed in output
   - No hardcoded credentials

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Configurable batch sizes (default: 5 per run)
   - Enforced delays between sessions (default: 3 hours)
   - Action delays between unfollows (default: 5 seconds)
   - State-based run frequency enforcement

3. **Anti-Detection**
   - Realistic user agent strings
   - Disabled automation control flags
   - Human-like delays
   - Conservative default settings

4. **State Persistence**
   - Prevents duplicate unfollows
   - Maintains operation history
   - Allows resumption after crashes
   - Tracks all account actions

5. **Error Recovery**
   - Graceful degradation on errors
   - Manual override options
   - Progress saved incrementally
   - Corrupted state auto-recovery

## Configuration Reference

### Environment Variables

```env
# Required
TIKTOK_USERNAME=your_username_or_email
TIKTOK_PASSWORD=your_password

# Optional (with defaults)
UNFOLLOW_DELAY=10800  # Seconds between batches (3 hours)
BATCH_SIZE=5          # Accounts per session
ACTION_DELAY=5        # Seconds between unfollows
HEADLESS=false        # Browser visibility
```

### Default Behavior
- Unfollows 5 accounts every 3 hours
- Shows browser window (HEADLESS=false)
- 5 second delay between each unfollow
- Saves state after each successful unfollow

### State File Format (state.json)
```json
{
  "last_run": "2025-10-29T13:30:00.123456",
  "processed_accounts": ["@user1", "@user2"],
  "unfollowed_accounts": [
    {
      "username": "@user1",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-29T13:30:05.123456"
    }
  ]
}
```

   - Corrupt state.json and verify recovery

### Production Monitoring

Monitor for:
- TikTok captcha challenges
- Login failures or session expiration
- Rate limit warnings from TikTok
- Unexpected account locks
- Changes to TikTok's UI/selectors

---

## Known Limitations

1. **UI Dependency**
   - Relies on TikTok's DOM structure and data-e2e attributes
   - May break if TikTok updates their UI
   - Requires manual selector updates if changed

2. **Detection Accuracy**
   - Based on pattern matching, not API access
   - May miss some invalid accounts
   - Could have false positives if patterns change

3. **Session Management**
   - Requires login on each run
   - No persistent browser session storage
   - MFA required every time if enabled

4. **Platform Limitations**
   - Designed for desktop browser automation
   - Requires GUI for browser display (unless headless)
   - Windows optimized (works on Linux/Mac with adjustments)

5. **TikTok Terms of Service**
   - Automation may violate TikTok's ToS
   - Account could be restricted or banned
   - No API access or official support

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Session Persistence**
   - Save browser cookies/session
   - Reduce login frequency
   - Handle MFA tokens

2. **Advanced Detection**
   - Machine learning for account classification
   - Profile analysis (missing bio, posts, etc.)
   - Activity-based detection (inactive accounts)

3. **Reporting**
   - HTML/PDF report generation
   - Statistics dashboard
   - Email notifications on completion

4. **Multi-Account Support**
   - Manage multiple TikTok accounts
   - Separate state files per account
   - Batch processing

5. **UI Improvements**
   - GUI for configuration
   - Real-time progress visualization
   - Interactive mode for reviewing before unfollow

6. **API Integration**
   - If TikTok releases official API
   - More reliable and ToS-compliant
   - Better rate limit handling
